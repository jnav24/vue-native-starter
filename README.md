# Vue Native Starter Repo

This is a personal setup for Vue Native which is a clone of [GeekyAnts Kitchen Sink App](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink)

## Instructions

Clone this repo and use the expo commands or npm commands to get going:

* **Run on iOS**
  * npm run start
  * npm run ios
  * npm run android
  * npm run eject

## Why clone?

I tried followig the doc on the Vue Native site in creating a project but was overloaded with errors. I also followed the instructions on possible solutions but was still getting errors. Cloning the Kitchen sink app was the only solution.
